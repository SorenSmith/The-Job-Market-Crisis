# The-Job-Market-Crisis

## Summary ##
Given the current uncertainty in the job market, I wanted to analyze which industries and companies are experiencing the most significant struggles, as well as whether the impact is as severe globally as portrayed in the media.

 To conduct this analysis, I obtained layoff data from 2024 through Kaggle.

 Dataset: Layoffs Data (2022-2024)

I then processed the data by cleaning and formatting it. This included:
- Removing unnecessary columns, such as List_of_Employees_Laid_Off, which contained incomplete or irrelevant data.
- Formatting numerical values for better readability, including converting percentage values to a more intuitive format.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Questions ##
This analysis aims to answer the following questions:
1. Which countries are experiencing the highest number of layoffs?
2. Which countries are seeing the lowest number of layoffs?
3. Which industries are most affected by layoffs?
4. Which companies have reported the highest number of layoffs?
5. Does the location of a company's headquarters influence layoff rates?

## ðŸ’­ Hypothesis ##
- Based on media reports, I expect North America and Europe to be experiencing the most significant layoffs.
- In contrast, I anticipate that Asian countries have been less affected by widespread layoffs.
- Industries such as crypto and travel are likely among the hardest hit, primarily due to decreased consumer spending. Manufacturing may also see significant layoffs.
- Large Corporations, such as Amazon, are expected to have higher layoff numbers compared to smaller, less prominent companies.
- I do not expect a company's headquarters locations to have a direct impact on its layoff rate.

## Executive Summary ##
Our analysis of the data indicates that the United States currently experiences the highest layoff rate globally, followed by India and several major European countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. While Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla recorded the highest number of layoffs in 2024, the retail industry saw the most significant job cuts, followed by the consumer sectorâ€”which includes businesses that produce, distribute, and sell goods and services directly to individuals, spanning industries such as food, clothing, electronics, and entertainment. Additionally, U.S.-based companies accounted for the highest number of layoffs, suggesting that a company's headquarters location may be a contributing factor in assessing layoff risks.
