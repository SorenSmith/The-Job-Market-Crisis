# The-Job-Market-Crisis

## Summary ##
Given the current uncertainty in the job market, I wanted to analyze which industries and companies are experiencing the most significant struggles, as well as whether the impact is as severe globally as portrayed in the media.

 To conduct this analysis, I obtained layoff data from 2024 through Kaggle.

 Dataset: Layoffs Data (2022-2024)

I then processed the data by cleaning and formatting it. This included:
- Removing unnecessary columns, such as List_of_Employees_Laid_Off, which contained incomplete or irrelevant data.
- Formatting numerical values for better readability, including converting percentage values to a more intuitive format.
